# Git-Tutorial
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files, typically in software development projects. <> It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git helps in managing different versions of a project by enabling users to:

Track changes: Git keeps a history of changes made to files, allowing users to revert to previous versions or compare changes over time.
Collaborate: Multiple people can work on the same project. Git manages and merges their changes efficiently.
Branching: Git allows users to create branches to work on different features or experiments without affecting the main project. These branches can later be merged back into the main codebase.
Backup: Since Git is distributed, each user has a full copy of the repository on their local machine, reducing the risk of data loss.
Key concepts in Git include:

Repository (repo): A collection of files and their history, typically stored in a .git directory.
Commit: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.
Branch: A separate line of development, allowing work to be done in parallel.
Merge: The process of combining changes from different branches.
Clone: Copying a repository from a remote location (e.g., GitHub) to a local machine.
Push/Pull: Sending or receiving changes to/from a remote repository.
Git is widely used in open-source and professional software development, with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket providing web-based interfaces for hosting Git repositories.
